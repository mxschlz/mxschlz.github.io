Hello world, I am Max!
I am a neuroscience PhD candidate at the [auditory cognition lab](https://auditorycognition.com/) at [University Lübeck](https://www.ipsy1.uni-luebeck.de/startseite), supervised by Dr. Malte Wöstmann. Together with him and Jonas Obleser, I am currently interested in subprocesses of auditory selective attention.
Specifically, my focus lies on delineating target enhancement from distractor capture and suppression. At the moment, main research methods comprise EEG and webcam-based eye and head tracking.
